- [ ] Set up accessibility testing

## Key Production Features Implemented

### Environment-Aware Logging
The application now uses environment-specific logging:
```typescript
import { debugLog, isDevelopment } from '@/utils/production';

// Only logs in development
debugLog('Session updated', sessionInfo);

// Conditional logging
if (isDevelopment()) {
  console.log('Debug info');
}
```

### Graceful Error Handling
Enhanced error boundaries and silent fail mechanisms:
- Production errors don't break the UI
- Non-critical operations fail silently
- User-friendly error messages
- Proper error reporting filters

### Performance Optimizations
- ✅ Route-based code splitting for optimal loading
- ✅ Lazy loading components with proper fallbacks
- ✅ Comprehensive performance monitoring with Web Vitals
- ✅ Bundle size analysis and optimization
- ✅ Memory usage monitoring and alerts

### Production Utilities
New utilities for production management:
- Environment detection
- Performance logging
- Error reporting configuration
- Feature flags
- Bundle analysis

### Advanced Performance Monitoring
- ✅ Real-time Web Vitals tracking (LCP, FID, CLS)
- ✅ Resource loading performance monitoring
- ✅ Memory usage tracking with alerts
- ✅ Bundle size monitoring and recommendations
- ✅ Navigation performance analysis

## Performance Metrics & Targets

### Current Performance Targets
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: < 2.5s
- **First Input Delay (FID)**: < 100ms
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: < 0.1
- **JavaScript Bundle Size**: < 1MB
- **CSS Bundle Size**: < 200KB
- **Memory Usage**: < 80% of available heap

### Monitoring Implementation
```typescript
// Comprehensive performance monitoring
const { measureWebVitals, measureMemoryUsage } = usePerformanceMonitoring();

// Bundle analysis
const metrics = BundleAnalyzer.analyzeBundleSize();
const recommendations = BundleAnalyzer.getPerformanceRecommendations(metrics);
```

## Next Steps for SWE Team

# Contributing to EMR System

## Overview

This EMR (Electronic Medical Records) system is built with security, compliance, and patient privacy as top priorities. All contributions must adhere to strict security and compliance standards.

## üîí Security Requirements

### Before You Contribute

1. **Security Clearance**: All contributors must be authorized to work with healthcare data
2. **Training**: Complete HIPAA and security awareness training
3. **Background Check**: May be required for certain types of contributions
4. **Access Control**: Follow principle of least privilege

### Code Security Standards

#### 1. Data Handling
- **Never** commit actual patient data or PHI to the repository
- Use synthetic/test data for development and testing
- All data access must go through proper authorization layers
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization

#### 2. Encryption Requirements
- All sensitive data must be encrypted at rest and in transit
- Use approved encryption algorithms (AES-256, etc.)
- Properly manage encryption keys (never commit keys to repo)
- Follow the existing encryption patterns in `/src/encryption.ts`

#### 3. Authentication & Authorization
- All API endpoints must implement proper authentication
- Use Row Level Security (RLS) in Supabase
- Follow the existing patterns in `/src/utils/security.ts`
- Implement proper session management

#### 4. Audit Logging
- All actions that access or modify data must be logged
- Use the existing audit system in `/src/services/audit/`
- Include sufficient detail for compliance reporting
- Follow the existing logging patterns

## üè• Healthcare Compliance

### HIPAA Requirements

All code changes must consider:

1. **Minimum Necessary Standard**: Only access data necessary for the specific function
2. **Access Controls**: Implement proper user role-based access
3. **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging of all PHI access
4. **Data Integrity**: Ensure data accuracy and protection from unauthorized changes
5. **Transmission Security**: Secure all data transmissions

### Documentation Requirements

- Security impact assessment for all changes
- Privacy impact documentation
- Compliance checklist completion
- Risk assessment for new features

## üîß Development Process

### 1. Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd emr-system

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Setup environment variables (use provided template)
cp .env.example .env.local

# Setup Supabase local development
supabase start
```

### 2. Code Style and Standards

#### TypeScript Guidelines
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Implement proper type definitions
- Use interfaces for data structures
- Follow existing naming conventions

#### React/UI Guidelines
- Use the existing component library
- Follow accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Implement proper error handling
- Use the design system tokens

#### Database Guidelines
- Use Supabase migrations for schema changes
- Implement proper RLS policies
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Add proper indexes for performance

### 3. Testing Requirements

#### Unit Tests
- Minimum 80% code coverage for new features
- Test security functions thoroughly
- Mock external dependencies
- Include edge cases and error scenarios

#### Integration Tests
- Test end-to-end workflows
- Verify audit logging
- Test permission boundaries
- Validate encryption/decryption

#### Security Tests
- Test authentication and authorization
- Verify data access controls
- Test input validation
- Check for common vulnerabilities

### 4. Review Process

#### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Security requirements met
- [ ] Compliance standards followed

- API endpoints
- Database schema changes

Must be reviewed by the security team.

#### Compliance Review
Changes affecting:
- PHI handling
- Audit trails
- User permissions
- Data retention
- Cross-system integration

Must be reviewed by the compliance team.

## üöÄ Deployment Process

### Staging Environment
1. All changes must be tested in staging first
2. Run automated security scans
3. Perform compliance validation
4. Load testing for performance
5. User acceptance testing

### Production Deployment
1. Security team approval required
2. Compliance sign-off needed
3. Maintenance window coordination
4. Rollback plan documented
5. Post-deployment monitoring
